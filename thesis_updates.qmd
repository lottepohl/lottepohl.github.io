Hi there! Below you find some general updates. The documents on the bottom of this page give a more detailed insight into my progress.

<!-- ### Updates 28.2.23 -->

<!-- We should set a focus quickly. Ideas: -->

<!-- 1. Pupping Grounds: Do *M. asterias* pup in the Western Scheldt? -->
<!--   - Investigate movement of tag 308 in summer 2019 (**what analyses?**) -->
<!--     - two separate potential pupping events close to Dishoek: how to investigate this further? -->
<!--   - Investigate fine-scale acoustic detections on females in the WS receiver arrays -->
<!--     - can the same behaviour (north-south movement) be seen there? -->
<!-- 2. Can low temperatures in winter explain the absence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt? -->
<!--   - get high resolution temperature data for the WS -->
<!--   - does the temp fall < 13 degree C (= temp threshold for *M. asterias*, Breve 2016) -->
<!--   - do a GLM, include e.g. salinity as well -->
<!--   - **where to get good data from?** -->
<!-- 3. What is the speed that *M. asterias* migrate with to their overwintering spots? Does that differ between males and females? -->
<!--   - calculate max. distance covered, max. swim speed (can I do this with 1 location/day from the geolocation model?), migration duration -->
<!-- 4. Are there diurnal patterns and (how) do they differ between different sections of their migratory cycles? -->
<!--   - FFT on the whole 1 year tracks of tag 308 and 321 -->
<!--   - Segment the tracks in migration, overwintering, migration, summer and do spectral analysis on the segments and compare (?) -->
<!--   - cleverer method? -->
<!--   - hesitant to use the approach by Heerah, 2017 because HMMs overestimate the amount of behavioural states (in my first analysis I had 7-8 behavioural states) -->
<!--   - But they use STFT which puts a window on the signal, this could be good for me (will investigate if FFT or STFT is better) -->

<!-- Aim 1: Resolve movement and behaviour in WS because in Scheldt Estuary, the focus was on the Oosterschelde so far. -->

<!-- Aim 2: Describe migration better to inform models in the future, has never been done for this species -->

<!-- ### Updates 27.2.23 -->

<!-- -   I plan to dedicate the month of March fully to data analysis -->
<!--     -   Vertical Home range analysis / KUD (DST data) -->
<!--     -   Horizontal Home range analysis / KUD (acoustic detection data) -->
<!--     -   behavioural segmentation with STFT/FFT and HMM (DST data) -->
<!--     -   actel and RSP analysis (acoustic detection data) -->
<!-- -   In April, I want to start writing and building the data visualisation/product, potentially using R [Flexdashboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/examples.html) (similar to RShiny). -->
<!-- -   In May, I would like to touch up on the analysis and the visualisation and concentrate on writing. -->

<!-- #### Central Questions -->

<!-- 1.  What Journal would you aim for publishing the thesis paper in? We already have to write the thesis in the Journal's format. My idea would be the *Journal of Animal Biotelemetry* or *Animal Living Resources*, what do you think? -->

<!-- 2.  Are you planning to go tagging some time? I would really like to join. -->

<!-- 3.  Do you know someone with expertise on visualising animal movement data in mind? Once I have a concept I would like to receive feedback from someone that specialises in this. Otherwise, I would try to contact e.g. [Somayeh Dodge](https://somayehdodge.info) who has many impressive publications on the topic. -->
