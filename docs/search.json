    "text": "I am currently writing my master thesis at the Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ) under the guidance of Jan Reubens, Niels Brevé and Carlota Muñiz. My thesis project involves data on the starry smooth-hound shark, collected by the European Tracking Network (ETN). I analyse and visualise the movement of 30 sharks in the most understandable way for non-scientists with an RShiny application. With my work I aim to bridge the gap between science and policy-making through maps and other visualisation methods.\n\n\n\nMy study course is the Erasmus Mundus master’s degree in Marine Biological Resources (IMBRSea) which gives me the priviledge to study at a different European university each semester! So far, I have studied in Oviedo in the north of Spain, in Villefranche in the south of France, and in Belgium. Before my master’s, I did a bachelor’s degree in Biomimetics at the City University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, Germany. Biomimetics is all about finding nature-inspired solutions for technical problems us humans have, and I learned lots about functional Biology, materials science, (fluid) mechanics, data analysis and project management. I describe myself as a biologist with an interest in data, computers and technology."

Now, after spending a good few years at university, I have developed a passion for data and using it to improve our knowledge on the ocean. I am interested in the intersection between science and policy-making, and I believe that in many countries today, science does not inform policy enough. Experts are great in executing complex analyses but what will happen beyond a scientific publication if only experts understand the results?\nI am motivated to contribute to closing this gap between scientific results and political decisions."

    "text": "Sea Diaries, pt. 1\nLast week, I was on a 3-day sea campaign with the 37 m Simon Stevin, a Belgian research vessel. We were out in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS), fun fact: this part of the North Sea is the most researched ocean part in the world [@reubens_2023].\nOn the boat were 19 people in total, amongst them 8 scientists. We were carrying out maintenance work that needs to be done regularly for the so-called European Tracking Network (ETN) to function. At one point in time, there are over 100  acoustic receivers in the water, which listen to underwater sounds.\nUnderwater sound can have different frequencies (humans can, for example, hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz), and the receivers that are in the water for ETN listen to frequencies of 69  kHz. That is, because the tags that were put inside different species of fish, emit pings with \\(\\pm\\) 69 kHz. They all differ slightly in frequency (they basically each have their own fingerprint frequency), by which the tag serial number, and with that the animal it’s inside, can be identified.\nThe acoustic receivers are attached to so-called moorings/tripods, heavy metal frames that are lowered to the seafloor. Many organisms that are free-floating in the water and would like to settle somewhere, for example mussels and barnacles. And this metal frame, a hard surface on all the sand on the seafloor, is a welcome settling ground. Every 6 months or so, each tripod needs to be lifted onto the ship. Then, the data is downloaded from the receiver, and the batteries are exchanged. And, the most time consuming thing of all, the tripod gets cleaned. This was my pleasure on the campain!\n\nYou basically need waterproof clothing, gloves, a life vest and a scraper to clean a tripod. And lots of muscles! Barnacles and other animals seem to love the tripods and they are very stubborn to get off, I can tell you that… At dinner on out first day at sea, I had scraped so much that I couldn’t hold a fork anymore :D\nWe had this very big metal frame of Clea, a PhD-student student in Hydroacoustics, which had a lot of surface and so a lot of cleaning/scraping work was required. It took 2-3 people around 2 hours to clean it all.\n\nBut as you clean, you see so many small animals that kreuchen und fleuchen everywhere! And even small anemones we saw. And tons of crabs!\n\n\nThe beauty of barnacles\nBarnacles are quite fascinating animals I find. They settle down once in their lifetime and they have this super-hard-to-crack shell that we always see. You cannot really imagine that there’s a living thing inside, right? Well, during the scraping we removed a lot of barnacles, so we could see the animals inside. I feel a bit bad for all the barnacle lives I ended during these days :(\nBut I wanted to share how the animal inside looks like!\n\n\n\nPlenty of fish/other things in the North Sea\nWe found astonishingly many different sea creatures! Nudibranchs, for example.\nWe were lucky to have a marine invertebrate nerd on board (thanks, Bram!) that just had a great sensitivity to spotting small, special animals on the tripods while cleaning them. Did you know there were nudibranches in the North Sea? Well, I have to admit, I didn’t. They were so tiny and so adorable!!\nAnd the amount of different crab species we found….just mind-blowing. I challenge everyone to rethink when they say that the North Sea is boring! I didn’t want to hear it at first either, but after literally playing with a bottlenose dolphin for an hour  I am slowly becoming an advocate for this muddy blue, cold water body."

During the winter period, however, there was not a single detection. So I then divided the detections by month.\nDetections range from April to October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, 14 females were detected 10655 times and 4 males were detected 285 times.\nI divided the study area into 3 parts: WS1 (the first array in the Westerscheldt), WS2 (the second, more east array in the Westerscheldt) and BPNS.\nWithin the BPNS, I grouped receivers more than 20 km away from the coast into offshore receivers and the ones closer than 20 km into coast receivers (analogous to Jolien Goossen’s Master Thesis).\n\n\n\n\n\ndetections per monthindividuals per month\n\n\n\nThe circle size corresponds to the number of detections from each station each month. It is relative to the total number of detections.\nThe red circles are detections of females, the blue circles are detections of males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got salinity data from the ScheldeMonitor. They only reach until Vlissingen, unfortunately. So it roughly is the WS2 area. Below you see salinity averages. For some reason, there are no data for January, Febuary and March.\n\nsalinity (per month)salinity (per month & year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe circle size corresponds to the number of individuals detected at a station each month.

By tagging 19 females and 11 males, we already integrated sex bias into the dataset. This bias further increased by only 4 males in contrast to 14 females being detected by a receiver.\nOne male was detected in the WS1 area. It must have swum into the array, because the sharks tagged in the WS (5km north of Cadzand) were all female. Between May and August, males are only detected in the BPNS. In the 4 months that males were detected, it was a different male each time (tag 311 in April, 315 in May, 316 in July and tag 295 in August).\nIn September, 2 females (tag 299 and 307) are detected in the WS2 area. There are only a couple of detections (38, on 22.09.2019 for tag 299 and 09.09.2019 for tag 307). Both these tags were also detected in the WS1 area in September 2019, tag 299 16 days before and 3 days after the detection in the WS2 area, and tag 307 1 day before and 7 days after. So tag 299 could have stayed in WS2 for 19 days, and tag 302 for 8 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall Residency Index (RI) is calculated by dividing the days of acoustic detections by the estimated battery time (for the ADST-V13TP it’s 518 days), for each tag.\nThe monthly Residency Index is calculated by dividing the days of detections in a month by the days of that month, for each tag.\nI further subdivided the monthly RI by grouping the detections per tag and month into the three areas (WS1, WS2 and BPNS) to get a Residency Index per area and month.\n\n\noverall RImonthly RIRI per area and month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left facet corresponds to females (f), the right facet corresponds to males (m).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome range analysis using horizontal Kernel Utilization Distribution (KUD).\nwhat kind of statistics could I do on these data? I would like to see if there are significant differences between sex, area and month (could also be grouped into season, i.e. early/mid/late summer). I am not sure how to proceed, because we have different n for males and females, and overall a very small number of individuals. Do you have a statistical method in mind that could come in handy in this case?\nIn her master thesis, Jolien Goossens did a Correspondance Analysis (CA) on her monthly Residency Indices. What do you think of doing that here as well?\nI have started the actel analysis and want to also use the RSP package which does home range analysis. \nOverall, I would like to look at environmental variables (salinity, temperature, pH, …) and try to infer correlations with shark detections with a GLMM. But that would be 2nd priority after the home range analysis."

I spent a day with it already, but it is not trivial to format the code to the M. asterias DST data. To correctly do this, I would need the help of someone that has already done this. Jolien supervised a thesis in 2020 (Camille Boileau-Locas), that did that as well, but I know she has a lot to do right now. Mathieu Woillez also co-authored the paper by Karine Heerah, so I could contact him as well, potentially. What do you suggest? The method of Heerah et al., 2017 uses STFT, a modified version of FFT. I was thinking that I maybe at first do a regular FFT to look at the periodic patterns of the signals.\nI would like to assess the fate of the 6 sharks that only logged for < 1 month. Currently, I have in mind that I could try to find rules and translate that into a fate (e.g. temp rise by xy degrees + regular surfacing intervals = fate_seal). Do you think I have any chances of trying to identify different fates(if there are any)?\nGriffiths et al., 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239480) did not use any fancy/complex Hidden Markov Models like Heerah but they calculated statistics such as the time spent at certain depth bins, vertical speed, seabed proximity, or vertical movement behaviour (based on a Wilcoxon test). This I would perform as a backup/complementary analysis with secondary priority, because I find the behavioural segmentation more interesting.\nDo you have any other analyses in mind that could shed light on behavioural patterns of the sharks?"
