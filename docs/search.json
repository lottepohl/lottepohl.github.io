    "text": "I am currently writing my master thesis at the Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ) under the guidance of Jan Reubens, Niels Brevé and Carlota Muñiz. My thesis project involves data on the starry smooth-hound shark, collected by the European Tracking Network (ETN). I analyse and visualise the movement of 30 sharks in the most understandable way for non-scientists with an RShiny application. With my work I aim to bridge the gap between science and policy-making through maps and other visualisation methods.\n\n\n\nMy study course is the Erasmus Mundus master’s degree in Marine Biological Resources (IMBRSea) which gives me the priviledge to study at a different European university each semester! So far, I have studied in Oviedo in the north of Spain, in Villefranche in the south of France, and in Belgium. Before my master’s, I did a bachelor’s degree in Biomimetics at the City University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, Germany. Biomimetics is all about finding nature-inspired solutions for technical problems us humans have, and I learned lots about functional Biology, materials science, (fluid) mechanics, data analysis and project management. I describe myself as a biologist with an interest in data, computers and technology."

    "text": "What drives me?\nWhen I was little, my dream was to become a marine biologist, without really knowing what that meant. Now, after spending a good few years at university, I have developed a passion for data and using it to improve our knowledge on the ocean. I am interested in the intersection between science and policy-making, and I believe that in many countries today, science does not inform policy enough. Experts are great in executing complex analyses but what will happen beyond a scientific publication if only experts understand the results?\nI am motivated to contribute to closing this gap between scientific results and political decisions."

    "text": "What were we doing?\nOn the Simon Stevin were 19 people in total, among them 8 scientists. We were carrying out maintenance work that needs to be done regularly for the so-called Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network (PBARN) to function. At one point in time, there are over 100  acoustic receivers in the water, which listen to underwater sounds. \nUnderwater sound can have different frequencies (humans can, for example, hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz), and the receivers that are in the water for the PBARN listen to frequencies of 69  kHz. That is, because the tags that were put inside different species of fish, emit acoustic pings with \\(\\pm\\) 69 kHz. They all differ slightly in frequency (they basically each have their own fingerprint frequency), by which the tag’s serial number, and with that the animal it’s inside, can be identified.\nThe acoustic receivers are attached to so-called tripods, heavy metal frames that are lowered to the seafloor. Many organisms that are free-floating in the water would like to settle somewhere, for example mussels and barnacles. And this metal frame, a hard surface on all the sand on the seafloor, is a welcome settling ground. Every 6 months or so, each tripod needs to be lifted onto the ship. Then, the data is downloaded from the receiver, and the batteries are exchanged. And, the most time consuming thing of all, the tripod gets cleaned. This was my pleasure on the campaign!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a tripod: The metal frame, on top of it an orange float, and in the centre of the float the acoustic receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe float is attached to the tripod with a release system that can be activated from afar, making the float surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloat and tripod are connected by a rope, and the tripod is heaved up by the ship with the rope. The tripod is located with a hydrophone deployed from the small boat you can see here.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou basically need waterproof clothing, gloves, a life vest and a scraper to clean a tripod. And lots of muscles! Barnacles and other animals seem to love the tripods and they are very stubborn to get off, I can tell you that… At dinner on out first day at sea, I had scraped so much that I couldn’t hold a fork anymore :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy colleague Arc’hantael Labriere and I busy cleaning a float, making it ready to be re-deployed. This took about 20 min for the two of us. Photo by the amazing David Casals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as you clean, you see so many small animals that move about everywhere! And even small anemones we saw. And tons of crabs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was so much life on the metal frames, truly astonighsing! Anemones, starfish, and so many crabs. Most of the crabs were tiny swimming crabs :) But we also had several big ones!"

    "text": "Growing up in Hamburg, Germany, the North Sea was all we talked about in (primary) school science lessons. What a unique ecosystem the Wadden Sea is, the amazing filtering capabilities of blue mussels, and how sandworms clean sand. TO be honest, I was pretty tired of it after the years. Everyone had been on a school trip to Sylt (a small German North Sea island) and did a walk across the mudflats where the guide swallowed a sandworm. I guess it’s easy to be unimpressed by things that are directly at your doorstep. At least that was the case for me. I was inhaling books about sharks in tropical waters by the age of 14 and longed to see the Great Barrier Reef with my own eyes, but didn’t care at all about the creatures inhabiting the sea closest to my home.\nGoing further, my undergrad was not marine-related at all. Well, we in fact were supposed to do an excursion to Helgoland which all of us were super excited about for years, and then Covid hit and we sampled plants on meadows in southern Bremen… During my master’s I have been out and about in southern Europe (France and Spain), but again didn’t get in touch with the North Sea.\nNow that I am working on a small shark in the North Sea for my Master Thesis, I find myself discovering the North Sea once more, and wow, it blows my mind! The diversity of animals that live here, species I really didn’t expect, that I hadn’t heard about in my early school years…\n\nI am developing a new level of appreciation for the small and large creatures that inhabit the ocean that is so close to where I come from. I want to share that with you.\n\nI truly hope that I can spark some thought-dead or even new fascination with the North Sea!"

During the winter period, however, there was not a single detection. So I then divided the detections by month.\nDetections range from April to October.\nOverall, 14 females were detected 1.0655^{4} times and 4 males were detected 285 times.\nI divided the study area into 3 parts: WS1 (the first array in the Westerscheldt), WS2 (the second, more east array in the Westerscheldt) and BPNS.\nWithin the BPNS, I grouped receivers more than 20 km away from the coast into offshore receivers and the ones closer than 20 km into coast receivers (analogous to Jolien Goossen’s Master Thesis).\n\n\n\n\n\ndetections per monthindividuals per month\n\n\n\nThe circle size corresponds to the number of detections from each station each month. It is relative to the total number of detections.\nThe red circles are detections of females, the blue circles are detections of males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got salinity data from the ScheldeMonitor. They only reach until Vlissingen, unfortunately. So it roughly is the WS2 area. Below you see salinity averages. For some reason, there are no data for January, Febuary and March.\n\nsalinity (per month)salinity (per month & year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe circle size corresponds to the number of individuals detected at a station each month.

By tagging 19 females and 11 males, we already integrated sex bias into the dataset. This bias further increased by only 4 males in contrast to 14 females being detected by a receiver.\nOne male was detected in the WS1 area. It must have swum into the array, because the sharks tagged in the WS (5km north of Cadzand) were all female. Between May and August, males are only detected in the BPNS. In the 4 months that males were detected, it was a different male each time (tag 311 in April, 315 in May, 316 in July and tag 295 in August).\nIn September, 2 females (tag 299 and 307) are detected in the WS2 area. There are only a couple of detections (38, on 22.09.2019 for tag 299 and 09.09.2019 for tag 307). Both these tags were also detected in the WS1 area in September 2019, tag 299 16 days before and 3 days after the detection in the WS2 area, and tag 307 1 day before and 7 days after. So tag 299 could have stayed in WS2 for 19 days, and tag 302 for 8 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall Residency Index (RI) is calculated by dividing the days of acoustic detections by the estimated battery time (for the ADST-V13TP it’s 518 days), for each tag.\nThe monthly Residency Index is calculated by dividing the days of detections in a month by the days of that month, for each tag.\nI further subdivided the monthly RI by grouping the detections per tag and month into the three areas (WS1, WS2 and BPNS) to get a Residency Index per area and month.\n\n\noverall RImonthly RIRI per area and month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left facet corresponds to females (f), the right facet corresponds to males (m).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n–>"
