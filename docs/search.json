From September 2023 onward, I am working with the Marine Observation Center at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) in Ostend, Belgium. ————————————————————————\n\nMy Master Thesis project involved the analysis of tracking data on the Starry smooth-hound shark Mustelus asterias, collected by the European Tracking Network (ETN). 30 individuals were equipped with novel Acoustic Data Storage Tags (ADST) a few years ago. These tags combine two tracking technologies, name acoustic tags and data storage/archival tags. The acoustic part of the tag emits a unique acoustic signal that can be picked up by an acoustic receiver that is placed under water (when the tag is within a certain range of the receiver, usually a few hundred meters). Such receiver networks are established more and more, in coastal waters. The receivers need to be maintained and accessed by humans (to download the detection data and change batteries, for instance). Moreover, the receivers are either submerged attached to heavy metal frames, or attached to buoys. For that reason, acoustic receivers can only be maintained in coastal, accessible areas. To also get data about the movement of fish when they are outside of areas that are covered by acoustic receivers, the second part of the tag logs environmental variables (most importantly, depth and temperature) in predefined intervals. To access these data logs, the tag needs to be retrieved, however.\nFor my thesis, I analysed both data on acoustic detections and depthlogs of the tags that were recovered.\n\n\n\n\nMy study course was the Erasmus Mundus master’s degree in Marine Biological Resources (IMBRSea) which gave me the priviledge to study at a different European university each semester! So far, I have studied in Oviedo in the north of Spain, in Villefranche in the south of France, and in Belgium. Before my master’s, I did a bachelor’s degree in Biomimetics at the City University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, Germany.

    "text": "What drives me?\nWhen I was little, my dream was to become a marine biologist, without really knowing what that meant. Now, after spending a good few years at university, I have developed a passion for data and using it to improve our knowledge on the ocean. I am interested in the intersection between science and policy-making, and I believe that in many countries today, science does not inform policy enough. Experts are great in executing complex analyses but what will happen beyond a scientific publication if only experts understand the results?\nI am motivated to contribute to closing this gap between scientific results and political decisions."

    "text": "What were we doing?\nOn the Simon Stevin were 19 people in total, among them 8 scientists. We were carrying out maintenance work that needs to be done regularly for the so-called Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network (PBARN) to function. At one point in time, there are over 100  acoustic receivers in the water, which listen to underwater sounds. \nUnderwater sound can have different frequencies (humans can, for example, hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz), and the receivers that are in the water for the PBARN listen to frequencies of 69  kHz. That is, because the tags that were put inside different species of fish, emit acoustic pings with \\(\\pm\\) 69 kHz. They all differ slightly in frequency (they basically each have their own fingerprint frequency), by which the tag’s serial number, and with that the animal it’s inside, can be identified.\nThe acoustic receivers are attached to so-called tripods, heavy metal frames that are lowered to the seafloor. Many organisms that are free-floating in the water would like to settle somewhere, for example mussels and barnacles. And this metal frame, a hard surface on all the sand on the seafloor, is a welcome settling ground. Every 6 months or so, each tripod needs to be lifted onto the ship. Then, the data is downloaded from the receiver, and the batteries are exchanged. And, the most time consuming thing of all, the tripod gets cleaned. This was my pleasure on the campaign!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a tripod: The metal frame, on top of it an orange float, and in the centre of the float the acoustic receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe float is attached to the tripod with a release system that can be activated from afar, making the float surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloat and tripod are connected by a rope, and the tripod is heaved up by the ship with the rope. The tripod is located with a hydrophone deployed from the small boat you can see here.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou basically need waterproof clothing, gloves, a life vest and a scraper to clean a tripod. And lots of muscles! Barnacles and other animals seem to love the tripods and they are very stubborn to get off, I can tell you that… At dinner on out first day at sea, I had scraped so much that I couldn’t hold a fork anymore :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy colleague Arc’hantael Labriere and I busy cleaning a float, making it ready to be re-deployed. This took about 20 min for the two of us. Photo by the amazing David Casals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as you clean, you see so many small animals that move about everywhere! And even small anemones we saw. And tons of crabs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was so much life on the metal frames, truly astonighsing! Anemones, starfish, and so many crabs. Most of the crabs were tiny swimming crabs :) But we also had several big ones!"

    "text": "Growing up in Hamburg, Germany, the North Sea was all we talked about in (primary) school science lessons. What a unique ecosystem the Wadden Sea is, the amazing filtering capabilities of blue mussels, and how sandworms clean sand. TO be honest, I was pretty tired of it after the years. Everyone had been on a school trip to Sylt (a small German North Sea island) and did a walk across the mudflats where the guide swallowed a sandworm. I guess it’s easy to be unimpressed by things that are directly at your doorstep. At least that was the case for me. I was inhaling books about sharks in tropical waters by the age of 14 and longed to see the Great Barrier Reef with my own eyes, but didn’t care at all about the creatures inhabiting the sea closest to my home.\nGoing further, my undergrad was not marine-related at all. Well, we in fact were supposed to do an excursion to Helgoland which all of us were super excited about for years, and then Covid hit and we sampled plants on meadows in southern Bremen… During my master’s I have been out and about in southern Europe (France and Spain), but again didn’t get in touch with the North Sea.\nNow that I am working on a small shark in the North Sea for my Master Thesis, I find myself discovering the North Sea once more, and wow, it blows my mind! The diversity of animals that live here, species I really didn’t expect, that I hadn’t heard about in my early school years…\n\nI am developing a new level of appreciation for the small and large creatures that inhabit the ocean that is so close to where I come from. I want to share that with you.\n\nI truly hope that I can spark some thought-dead or even new fascination with the North Sea!"
