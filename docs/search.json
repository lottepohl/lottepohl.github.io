    "text": "Two tag serial numbers where only detected once: 1293296 and 1293301, and where thus omitted.\nFemales had a mean TL of 85.84 cm (\\(\\pm\\) 10.26, n = 19), and males had a mean TL of 77.64 cm (\\(\\pm\\) 3.75, n = 11).\n\n\n\nLast time, we wanted to resolve further how detections might differ between sex and season.\nI first divided the year into summer (from 1st of April to 30th of September) and winter (rest). During the winter period, however, there was not a single detection. So I then divided the detections by month.\nDetections range from April to October.\nOverall, 14 females were detected 10655 times and 4 males were detected 285 times.\nI divided the study area into 3 parts: WS1 (the first array in the Westerscheldt), WS2 (the second, more east array in the Westerscheldt) and BPNS.\n\n\n\n\n\ndetections per monthindividuals per month\n\n\n\nThe circle size corresponds to the number of detections from each station each month. It is relative to the total number of detections.\nThe red circles are detections of females, the blue circles are detections of males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe circle size corresponds to the number of individuals detected at a station each month. It is relative to the total number of detected individuals.\nThe red circles are detections of females, the blue circles are detections of males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetections per monthindividuals per month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upper facet corresponds to females (f), the lower facet corresponds to males (m).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upper facet corresponds to females (f), the lower facet corresponds to males (m).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll detections, the colour denotes the area and the symbol denotes the sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that females overall dominate the detections. By tagging 19 females and 11 males, we already integrated sex bias into the dataset. This bias further increased by only 4 males in contrast to 14 females being detected by a receiver.\nOne male was detected in the WS1 area. It must have swum into the array, because the sharks tagged in the WS (5km north of Cadzand) were all female. Between May and August, males are only detected in the BPNS. In the 4 months that males were detected, it was a different male each time (tag 311 in April, 315 in May, 316 in July and tag 295 in August).\nIn September, 2 females (tag 299 and 307) are detected in the WS2 area. There are only a couple of detections (38, on 22.09.2019 for tag 299 and 09.09.2019 for tag 307). Both these tags were also detected in the WS1 area in September 2019, tag 299 16 days before and 3 days after the detection in the WS2 area, and tag 307 1 day before and 7 days after. So tag 299 could have stayed in WS2 for 19 days, and tag 302 for 8 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall Residency Index (RI) is calculated by dividing the days of acoustic detections by the days of liberty (i.e. the days between the release and the last detection), for each tag.\nThe monthly Residency Index is calculated by dividing the days of detections in a month by the days of that month, for each tag.\nI further subdivided the monthly RI by grouping the detections per tag and month into the three areas (WS1, WS2 and BPNS) to get a Residency Index per area and month.\n\n\noverall RImonthly RIRI per area and month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left facet corresponds to females (f), the right facet corresponds to males (m).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat kind of statistics could I do on these data? I would like to see if there are significant differences between sex, area and month (could also be grouped into season, i.e. early/mid/late summer).\nI am not sure how to proceed, because we have different n for males and females, and overall a very small number of individuals. Do you have a statistical method in mind that could come in handy in this case?\nIn her master thesis, Jolien did a Correspondance Analysis (CA) on her monthly Residency Indices. What do you think of doing that here as well?\nI have wanted to analyse the dataset using the R packages actel https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13503 and RSP https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13484 for some weeks now. This would be my next step for the acoustic detection data."

This was done by Heerah et al., 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40462-017-0111-3). I spent a day with it already, but it is not trivial to format the code to the M. asterias DST data. To correctly do this, I would need the help of someone that has already done this. Jolien supervised a thesis in 2020 (Camille Boileau-Locas), that did that as well, but I know she has a lot to do right now. Mathieu Woillez also co-authored the paper by Karine Heerah, so I could contact him as well, potentially. What do you suggest?\nThe method of Heerah et al., 2017 uses STFT, a modified version of FFT. I was thinking that I maybe at first do a regular FFT to look at the periodic patterns of the signals.\nGriffiths et al., 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239480) did not use any fancy/complex Hidden Markov Models like Heerah but they calculated statistics such as the time spent at certain depth bins, vertical speed, seabed proximity, or vertical movement behvaiour (based on a Wilcoxon test).\nI am unsure right now what analyses could best shed light on behavioural patterns of the sharks. What are your suggestions?"
